```

### Design principle

PM commands delegate to internal engines and only:
- Manage the PR (open, update status, history)
- Verify gates before executing each step
- Detect progress and optimize re-entry points (e.g. skip already-completed steps)
- Provide clear next-step instructions

**The PR body is the source of truth** — `gh pr view --json body` determines workflow state, not local files.

### PM command flow

| Command | Internal call chain |
|---|---|
| `/product-flow:start` | create branch + Draft PR → `speckit.specify` → `speckit.retro` |
| `/product-flow:continue` | state machine: `SPEC_REVIEW` → `consolidate-spec` / `PLAN_PENDING` → `plan` / `PLAN_REVIEW` → `consolidate-plan` (dispatched by state machine) |
| `/product-flow:build` | `tasks` → `checklist` → `implement` (→ `praxis.bdd-with-approvals` *(TS/JS only)* → `speckit.implement.withTDD` → `praxis.code-simplifier` → `praxis.test-desiderata` → proposes `speckit.verify-tasks`) |
| `/product-flow:submit` | `speckit.verify` (gate: CRITICAL blocks, HIGH/MEDIUM asks, passes silently) → git add/commit/push → `gh pr ready` on first run (exits DRAFT) |
| `/product-flow:deploy-to-stage` | gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch |

---

## 2. Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login

brew install jq
```

Verify:
```bash
gh auth status
gh pr list
```

The `speckit.taskstoissues` skill (called by `/product-flow:build`) requires the **GitHub MCP server** to create issues. Install it via Claude Code:

```
/mcp add github
```

Without it, task generation still works but GitHub issues will not be created.

### Install in a project

Inside Claude Code in your project:

```
/plugin marketplace add git@github.com:deuveme/product-flow.git
/plugin install product-flow@product-flow
```

### Configure settings.json


```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(git *)",
      "Bash(gh pr *)",
      "Bash(gh issue *)",
      "Bash(gh run *)",
      "Bash(jq *)",
      "Bash(mkdir *)",
      "Bash(cp *)",
      "Bash(chmod *)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(git push --force*)",
      "Bash(git reset --hard *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Verify

```
/product-flow:status
```

Expected: `📍 main  ·  no active feature`

## 3. Workflow details

### `/product-flow:continue` state machine

```
/product-flow:start
  │
  ▼
SPEC_CREATED  ←──── /product-flow:consolidate-spec ←──── SPEC_REVIEW  (team adds comments)
  │ (no comments)
  ▼
PLAN_PENDING  ──── /product-flow:plan auto-runs ─────────────────────────────────────────┐
                                                                                         │
  (team adds comments on plan)                                                            ▼
PLAN_REVIEW   ←──── /product-flow:consolidate-plan ──────────────────────────────  PLAN_PENDING
  │ (no comments)
  ▼
BUILD_READY   ──── redirect to /product-flow:build
```

### PR draft lifecycle

The PR is created as a **Draft** by `/product-flow:start` and stays in Draft through the entire spec → plan → build phase. The team can see the PR and comment on it, but GitHub does not request their review.

When `/product-flow:submit` runs for the **first time**, it calls `gh pr ready` to exit Draft mode and trigger a GitHub review request notification. Subsequent `/product-flow:submit` calls only push new commits — they do not call `gh pr ready` again.

The only approval gate is at `/product-flow:deploy-to-stage`, which requires the PR to be approved by the team before merging.

### PR comment classification

When `/product-flow:continue` processes comments on the PR, it classifies each one before acting on it:

| Type | Criteria | How it's handled |
|---|---|---|
| **Non-technical** | Business intent, priorities, user flows, terminology, functional scope | **Always surfaced to the PM. Never resolved autonomously.** |
| **Technical** | Architecture, security, integrations, data model, infrastructure, implementation patterns | Resolved autonomously using project context |

**For autonomously resolved technical questions**, Claude posts a comment on the PR:

```
<!-- id:q3 type:technical status:ANSWERED -->
**Question 3 · Type: technical · Status: ANSWERED**

**Technical question detected:** "..."

**Proposed answers:** A. "..." B. "..." C. "..."

**Autonomously chosen answer:** We chose "..." because "..."

> 💬 To change this decision, add a new comment: `Question 3. Correction: [letter or answer]`
```

**For unresolved technical questions** (insufficient project context), Claude posts:

```
<!-- id:q4 type:technical status:UNANSWERED -->
**Question 4 · Type: technical · Status: UNANSWERED**

**Technical question detected:** "..."

**Possible answers:** A. "..." B. "..." C. "..."

⚠️ Unresolved — requires input from the development team.

> 💬 To answer, add a new comment: `Question 4. Answer: [letter or answer]`
```

To respond, add a **new top-level comment** to the PR (GitHub does not support direct replies). The format is flexible — all of these are valid:

```
Question 4. Answer: B
Q4: B
Question 4 - Answer: go with option B because...
```

Multiple responses for the same question are allowed — the last one wins. A single comment can respond to multiple questions, one per line.

On the next `/product-flow:continue` run, Claude picks up those answers and continues.

### Comment lifecycle (pr-comments skill)

Bot comments are tracked via invisible HTML markers on the first line:
- `<!-- id:q<N> type:technical|product status:UNANSWERED -->` — pending, will be processed by `/product-flow:continue`
- `<!-- id:q<N> type:technical|product status:ANSWERED -->` — processed, will be ignored in future runs

All bot comments are written via `/product-flow:pr-comments write`, which handles numbering automatically. `/product-flow:pr-comments pending` returns all `UNANSWERED` comments. `/product-flow:pr-comments resolve` rewrites them to `ANSWERED` after processing.

### Key workflow steps

**`plan` skill:**
1. Calls `/product-flow:speckit.plan` → generates `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`
2. Calls `/product-flow:praxis.complexity-review` → challenges design against 30 dimensions
3. Calls `/product-flow:praxis.backend-architecture` (if backend) → validates hexagonal structure
4. Calls `/product-flow:praxis.frontend-architecture` (if frontend) → validates feature-based structure
5. Posts technical decisions as PR comments
6. Calls `/product-flow:speckit.retro` for quality validation

**`implement` skill:**
1. Calls `/product-flow:praxis.bdd-with-approvals` → writes approval fixtures (executable specs)
2. Calls `/product-flow:speckit.implement.withTDD` → implements with Red-Green-Refactor TDD + ZOMBIES, then polishes with `/product-flow:praxis.code-simplifier`. As each task is completed, its GitHub issue (linked via `#N` in `tasks.md`) is closed automatically
3. Calls `/product-flow:praxis.test-desiderata` → validates test quality against Kent Beck's 12 properties
4. Calls `/product-flow:speckit.retro` for quality validation

**`tasks` skill:**
1. Calls `/product-flow:speckit.tasks` → generates `tasks.md` ordered by dependencies
2. Calls `/product-flow:speckit.taskstoissues` → creates one GitHub issue per task; writes the issue number `(#N)` back into each task line in `tasks.md`; adds `Closes #N` references to the PR body so GitHub auto-closes linked issues on merge

### Automatic quality gates

These three skills are **internal** — they are not invokable directly. The
orchestrators decide when to run them:

| Skill | Triggered by | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `speckit.verify` | `/product-flow:submit` (always) | Validates implementation against spec, plan, tasks, constitution. CRITICAL findings block submit; HIGH/MEDIUM ask the user; clean pass is silent |
| `speckit.verify-tasks` | `/product-flow:build` (proposed) | Proposed at the end of implement. User chooses: run now, open a new session, or skip |
| `speckit.reconcile` | `speckit.verify` (user opt-in on CRITICAL) | When verify finds CRITICAL drift, the user is offered two options: fix manually (A) or reconcile (B). Only invoked if the user chooses B and provides a gap description |

### Optional praxis skills (manual invocation)

These skills are not called automatically by any workflow step. Invoke them explicitly when the situation calls for it:

| Skill | When to use | How to invoke |
|---|---|---|
| `/product-flow:praxis.collaborative-design` | Feature is ambiguous — before running `/product-flow:start`, use this to explore the problem space visually with story splitting and vertical slicing | Say: "Let's explore this feature with collaborative design" |
| `/product-flow:praxis.event-modeling` | Feature involves integrations, automations, or reactive logic — use during planning to decompose into STATE_CHANGE / STATE_VIEW / AUTOMATION slices before `speckit.plan` | Say: "Let's model this with event modeling" |
| `/product-flow:praxis.expand-contract` | Plan includes breaking changes (rename DB column, change API contract, replace service) — use to define the three migration phases | Say: "Apply expand-contract to this migration" |
| `/product-flow:speckit.split` | Spec covers too many bounded contexts, user personas, or independent deliverables — use after `speckit.specify`, `speckit.clarify`, or `speckit.plan` and before `speckit.tasks` to extract the excess scope into a new branch with its own draft PR. Also offered automatically as a handoff button at the end of those three skills. | Say: "Analyze if this spec should be split" or use the handoff button |

## 4. How to modify skills

### SKILL.md structure

```markdown
---
description: "Shown in Claude Code autocomplete"
user-invocable: false        # optional — Claude-only (hides from user /menu)
context: fork                # optional — runs in isolated subagent
handoffs:                    # optional — transition buttons to other skills
  - label: "Next Step"
    agent: other-skill
    prompt: "Continue with..."
    send: true
tools: ['github/github-mcp-server/issue_write']  # optional — required MCP tools
---

## Execution

### 1. Pre-checks
...
### 2. Gate (if applicable)
...
### 3. Main logic
...
### 4. Update PR status
...
### 5. Final report
...
### Session close
Invoke `/product-flow:context`.
```

### Naming conventions

| Case | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| New skill | Any name | `consolidate-plan` |
| Fork of upstream skill | `<upstream>.<name>.with<Change>` | `speckit.implement.withTDD` |
| Unmodified upstream | Keep original name | `praxis.complexity-review` |

**Important:** `speckit.*` and `praxis.*` skills are upstream. Do not modify them. Fork with the `withX` suffix instead.

### Adding a new skill

1. Create `plugins/product-flow/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`
2. Add to `plugins/product-flow/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — all skills must be registered, both public and internal
3. Add bash permissions to project's `settings.json` if needed
4. Update PR template in `/product-flow:start` SKILL.md if adding a workflow step
5. Update `/product-flow:status` SKILL.md if adding a progress indicator

### Modifying an existing skill

- **Upstream skills** (`speckit.*`, `praxis.*`): fork with `withX` suffix
- **Internal skills** (`consolidate-spec`, `plan`, etc.): freely editable
- Update `/product-flow:continue` SKILL.md if changing state machine
- Update `/product-flow:status` SKILL.md if changing gates

### Conventions

- Errors: `🚫 BLOCKED` or `ERROR:`
- Success: `✅`
- Next step: always in a `─────` delimited block
- Gates: read PR with `gh pr view --json body`, never local files
- Error messages: actionable, explain what failed and why
